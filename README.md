# ospri-ai
My project is a part of Duke's Open Source Pedagogy, Research + Innovation (OSPRI) Lab.

See the [wiki][wiki].



This repository contains:

* A [notebook][notebook] that prototypes the reinforcement model proposed in Bellotti et al.'s [paper][paper] about "Adaptive Experience Engine for Serious Games."
  * To "run" the prototype that simulates Bellotti et al.'s model, run all of the cells down to the cell that calls the Q-learning function (e.g. q_learning(estimator, 3, epsilon=0.0))
